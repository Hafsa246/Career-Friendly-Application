# Career-Friendly-Application

Diversity Hackathon 2022 by Standard Chartered

With the help of this application, we aim to provide free technological/career related advice/services to women in need. We want to introduce all the knowledge to start a project/business in general and specifically different fields such as content writing, management, operations, etc. The application should facilitate the method of choosing a mentor based on the user's career preferences.
